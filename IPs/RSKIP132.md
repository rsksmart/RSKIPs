# **Abstract**

This RSKIP proposes an the re-pricing of the method ReceiveHeaders in the Bridge contract.
Currently the cost is fixed at 25K gas and a variable cost of 1650 per additional header. We've performed performance tests which show that this method is underpriced, both in ther fixed and variable components.
	

# **Motivation**

Make the RSK platform fair in terms of gas costs and prevent potential DoS attacks.

# **Specification**

The fixed gas component of the ReceiveHeaders call is increased from 25K to 66K. The variable gas component (affecting additional headers except the first) is increased from 1650 to 3500.

# Backwards Compatibility

This change is a hard-fork and therefore all full nodes must be updated. 

# Test Cases

TBD

## Security Considerations

This change improves the security of the network by preventing potential DoS attacks based on repeated ReceiveHeaders calls.
