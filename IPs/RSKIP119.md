## Abstract

A new precompiled contract (i.e., native, hardwired onto the RSK consensus layer) is introduced. This contract contains operations to allow inspection of several block header fields that can be useful for smart contract developers.

## Motivation

Exploring the headers of specific blocks from solidity code (or assembly WOLOG) executing on the RVM could be too expensive. Doing this directly in solidity would require to write it and test it multiple times. Furthermore, different implementations can lead to errors potentially protruding to loss of funds. A well-written, tested and precompiled function set of operations to access the block header fields will tackle these problems while at the same time it will enforce certain level of security by implementing these as part of the RSK consensus.

## Specification
                                                    
A new precompiled contract will be accessible at the `0x0000000000000000000000000000000001000010` address. It will implement the following functions (signatures and return values are as follows):

- `getBitcoinHeader(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getBlockHash(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getCoinbaseAddress(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getGasLimit(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getGasUsed(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getMergedMiningTags(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getMinGasPrice(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getRSKDifficulty(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)`
- `getUncleCoinbaseAddress(uint256 blockDepth, uint256 uncleIndex) returns (bytes)`

There is a limitation on how deep the block to inspect can be from the executing block. It is possible to recover fields of the past 4000 blocks, meaning that the blockDepth must be a value between 0 and 3999 inclusive, where blockDepth 0 references the parent block of the executing block, blockDepth 1 references the grandparent of the executing block and so on. If there is no block at the specified depth, an empty byte array is returned.

## Error handling

In case of error, each of these methods behaves as if a solidity `assert` statement was being used. That is, contract state is reverted and all the gas is consumed.

### getBitcoinHeader

The method `getBitcoinHeader(uint256 blockDepth) returns (bytes)` takes as input the depth of the block to query block header fields from and returns a byte array representation of the associated Bitcoin merged mining header.

#### Validations

- `blockDepth` must be an unsigned value ranging from 0 to 3999.

#### Gas cost

This method has a fixed cost of 1,000 gas units. On top of that, normal transaction gas costs apply.

```
getBitcoinHeader(5000) => []
