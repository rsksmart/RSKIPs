## Abstract
Recent experiments [0, 1] indicate that some EVM opcodes used to read from blockchain state trie are relatively *underpriced*. For instance, `SLOAD` costs 200 gas. However, by one measure, the *implicit cost* of an `SLOAD` lies between 1000 gas (full state cache, no disk IO) and 80000 gas (no cache, pure disk IO). This RSKIP proposes a conservative re-pricing of such opcodes to better reflect their resource use.

## Motivation

Executing transactions requires accessing the latest snapshot of *blockchain state* -- this includes account balances, nonces, contract code, and contract storage. In RSK, state is stored using the *unitrie*. In the reference client implementation ([RSKJ](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj)), the unitrie is backed up on disk using a LevelDB key-value datastore. Only some portions of the unitrie are loaded on to RAM as needed to execute transactions.

As indicated by recent experiments [0, 1] The current state of the RSK network can be read from disk at the rate of about 400 unitrie nodes per second.  Caching some nodes in memory leads to a 10X increase in *lookup speed*  to about 3000 nodes/sec. Loading the *entire current state* of the RSK mainnet increases the lookup speed by 100X, relative to reading from disk, to around 35000 nodes/sec. The tradeoff is that this requires an additional 250MB of RAM to store the entire state snapshot in memory.

Suppose 1 gas is about 30 nanoseconds of VM execution time (see Rationale section below). Even with the most favorable scenario of keeping the entire trie in memory (35K lookups/sec),  each lookup takes nearly 28500 nanoseconds. Thus, a trie node lookup has an *implicit cost* of about 950 gas (using 1 gas = 30 ns). However, the current cost of `BAL` is 400 gas while a `SLOAD` costs just 200 gas. Both of these codes are used quite frequently. Recall that reading from disk is much slower, about 400 nodes per second. That implies an implicit cost of 83000 gas for a lookup.

Thus, depending on how much state is cached in RAM, the implicit cost of an `SLOAD` (priced at 200 gas) can vary from 1000 gas to 83000 gas. Again, this is assuming a ratio of 1 gas:30ns. Our proposed changes are quite conservative. Correcting underpriced operations to reflect their actual resource consumption improves security (from IO attacks), scalability and fairness.

## Specification

This proposal requires a hard fork and needs to be a part of a future network upgrade - activation block height to be determined.

|OpCode         |Current cost | New Cost |
| :------------ |:------------|:----     |
| `SLOAD (0x04)`  | 200 gas | 800 gas |
| `BAL (0x31)` | 400 gas | 700 gas |
| `EXTCODEHASH (0x3F`) |400 gas | 700 gas |


The revised gas cost structure will resemble that of Ethereum post Istanbul, see [EIP-1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) [3]. RSK strives to maintain (reasonable) compatibility with EVM opcodes. One component of EIP-1884, the `SELF-BALANCE` opcode, has already been implemented in RSK. However, it is not our goal to match Ethereum's gas schedule. Indeed, the current gas schedule in Ethereum has evolved even further away from RSK's post EIP-2929. Rather, we propose these changes because they make sense for RSK at this point, given recent research and as the RSK community plans for the next network upgrade.

## Rationale

### Gas and resource use
There is no unique way to quantify the relationship between resource usage (computation, memory, bandwidth, energy) and resource pricing (gas cost). We have to use some proxy to approximate this relationship. 

We can use experiments to *calibrate* gas for various operations in terms of some simple resource metric - such as execution time. One way to track resource use is through `VMPerformanceTest` which is part of RSKJ reference implementation [2]. For example, running this test on an Amazon AWS EC2 `M5a.large` instance (with 2 vCPUs and 8GB RAM) provides an average ratio of about `50 ns per gas`. This estimate changes to `1 gas = 30 ns` on faster (but still "consumer grade") machines.

Another way to think about resource use is to take a ratio of `blockGasLimit` (currently 6.8M gas) with some maximum `maxBlockExecutionTime` (e.g. 300 milliseconds). This provides a ratio of around `1 gas = 45ns`. Since blocks are executed twice when connecting them, we can think of the ratio as being closer to 1:20 instead.

As node software and network usage evolve over time, the gas schedule can be periodically updated using new measurements. Further increases in trie read costs may be needed in the future with increase in state size and disk IO overhead.

## Backwards Compatibility

As already mentioned, this change needs a hard fork. In most cases, increasing the `gaslimit` is enough to account for repricing. RPC method to `estimate_gas` will provide reasonable guidance. However, increasing opcode costs can lead to some breaking changes.

*Value-transferring* `CALL`s cost 9000 gas. From this 9000, an amount 2300 gas is subtracted as a *call stipend* and passed to the *receiving* contract. Solidity automatically adds the stipend as a gaslimit for the internal CALL.

The call stipend is not high enough to modify state e.g. no `SSTORE`. This helps avoid re-entrancy type attacks. The stipend is intended to cover the cost for logging the value transfer. This RSKIP does not change any logging costs and most transfers should not be impacted. However, if the receiving contract performs *three or more*  `BAL` or `SLOAD` operations as part of logging, then such CALLs will fail.

Similarly, contracts that make CALLs to external contacts with specific gas limits can also fail. Such patterns have been discouraged for quite some time now, at least since EIP-150, which increased awareness that gas costs can change  and developers should not make their execution logic rely on the gas schedule. 

We think such breaks will be rare in RSK. We also note that the Ethereum community has deliberated and implemented potentially breaking changes multiple times (EIP-150, EIP-1884, EIP-2929 [4]).

## Implementations

None.

## Test Cases

Should verify that the gascost of `SLOAD`, `BAL` and `EXTCODEHASH` are updated as proposed at the correct activation block height (to be determined)
