## Abstract

This RSKIP outlines the consensus changes proposed for inclusion in Rootstockâ€™s upcoming network upgrade, code-named Reed. Some of the proposed RSKIPs, if ultimately approved, are intended to activate only on the Rootstock Testnet initially, as part of an incremental rollout strategy that allows for validation in a less critical environment before Mainnet deployment. These RSKIPs are marked with the (Testnet-only) tag below.

## Specification

- Codename: Reed
- Activation:
	- Rootstock Mainnet block: 8,052,200
	- Rootstock Testnet block: 6,835,700

### Included RSKIPs

- [RSKIP-305](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP305.md): Peg-out efficiency improvement (Segwit)
- [RSKIP-516](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP516.md): Precompiled contracts for +/* on Secp256k1

### Accepted RSKIPs
